Notes and snippets on how different types of software repositories / dependency managers work.

## Ideas to look at

Popular programming languages according to [StackOverflow 2024](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#2-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages), noting down typical dependency manager and public repository.

- Python - `pip` to https://pypi.org/
- JavaScript - `npm` and https://www.npmjs.com/
- ~~SQL~~
- ~~HTML/CSS~~
- ~~TypeScript~~ - would use NPM
- Rust - `cargo` to https://crates.io/
- Go - built-in, mostly hosted via https://pkg.go.dev/
- ~~Bash/Shell~~
- C# - `nuget` and https://www.nuget.org/
- C++ - maybe `vcpkg` or `conan`, more research required.
- Java - Maven/Gradle and https://central.sonatype.com/
- ~~C~~ - seems C++ dependency manager do C as well.
- ~~Kotlin~~ - Same dependency management as Java.
- PHP - `composer` and https://packagist.org/
- ~~PowerShell~~ - PowerShell repos are a thing but its Windows-specific.
- Swift - SPM and https://swiftpackageindex.com/
- Dart - `pub` and https://pub.dev/
- Zig - built-in, no central repository.
- Lua - LuaRocks and https://luarocks.org/ - unsure how widespread it is.
- ~~Assembly~~
- Elixir - `hex` and https://hex.pm/
- Ruby - `gem` and https://rubygems.org/
